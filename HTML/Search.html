                User can search the recipe by entering its name in the text box.<br />
                API response contains recipes of all the items matching with that word.
                I am returning 4 recipe's images and titles returned from it.<br /><br />
                Then on click on the 'Recipe' button I am displaying recipe details same as in the cuisine tab<br />
                In case of a random/wrong input I am displaying appropriate error message.<br /><br />
                On click on the 'Recipe' button I am making an entry in a database to keep the counter of viewed
                recipe. For the Recipe being viewed for the first time I am making an entry with its RecipeID
                and counter equalt to 1. For already viewed recipe I am incrementing its counter by 1.

                I have learnt to use user's input value to make an API request.<br />
                I have learnt to indicate user's on their wrong input in search box.<br />
                I have handled the cases of no result found and api limit reached differenly so the user will
                know for what particular reason the output is not being generated.<br /><br />
                I have learnt to make a web service to make entry into database on user action on html pages.<br />
                I have used stored procedure to make entry in database table.<br />

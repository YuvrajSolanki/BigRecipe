               Here I am displaying images and titles of the recipes which are viewed most using BigRecipe.<br />
                Top 4 viewed recipes in search tab will appear in this popular tab.<br />
                Search for some particular item in search tab and click on its 'recipe' button to see its recipe.<br />
                Do it frequently and you would see that item appearing in popular tab.

               I have learnt to use web service to fetch data from the database table and use it to make api request.<br />
               <br /> Here I am making API request using the RecipeIDs of the top 4 viewed recipes in search tab.<br />
                I have made these API requests using a loop. Each time user clicks on the popular tab I have to make
                this requests.<br />
                There would be increment of 4 images each time user clicks on Popular tab. If I empty out the html 
                elements before each call only the last api request's response will able to create its html.<br /><br />
                To solve this problem I have taken ids of these images in sequence. So in a loop I am setting
                this images sources using these sequential ids. And making it clear on click on the popular tab.<br />
                <p>$("#popular" + i).attr("src", data.Results[0].ImageURL120);</p>

            <span>I have displayed eight images of different varieties in this tab.
                This images have ids attached with them. <br />
                On click on the image I am redirecting users to the varieties.html page along with the id
                of the clicked image.<br /><br />
                On this varieties.html page I am making an API request using the id received from the previous page.<br />
                The request returns recipe details, I am displaying images and titles of 8 of them.<br /><br />
                Now, on click on the image I am redirecting users to the varities1.html page along with its RecipeID.<br />
                Here I am making an API request using RecipeID to get the recipe details of that particular item.<br /><br />
                I am displaying image of the recipe and its recipe details on varieties1.html.<br />
                I have created an accordian using check-box to display recipe details.<br />
                Recipe details includes recipe title, recipe description, cuisine, category, preparation time,
                ingredients and recipe method.<br />                
            </span>

                I have learnt to make responsive page. In my home tab image's width and height will respond to the
                window size.<br /><br />
                I have learnt to send parameters while redirecting. In my varieties.html and varieties1.html page
                I am using values obtained from the selection on previous pages. I am using this values to make
                an API request.<br /><br />
                I have learnt  to make an accordian using check box. It is useful to display more information in limited space.<br /><br />
                In ingredients I am using ingredient's name, quantity and unit. Some of the ingredients contains
                null value for unit. So I couldn't append them directly. So I checked for unit's valued before appending
                it.
